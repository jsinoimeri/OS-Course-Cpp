              Part 2 -> Two programming solutions to the Sleeping Barber Problem. 
                        First solution uses pipes to communicate between the three
                        processes while the second uses Semaphores and shared memory 
                        to communicate between the three processes.

                        to compile and run the code and two .txt files explaining
                        conditons, if any, that lead to deadlock between the three
                        processes and a brief explanation of the execution order of
