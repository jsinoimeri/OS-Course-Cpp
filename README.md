OS-Course-Cpp
=============

Operating Systems course using C/C++


Assignment 1:

              Part 1 -> Answers to the concept questions in the pdf file on course website.
              
              Part 2 -> Two programming solutions to the Sleeping Barber Problem. 
                        First solution uses pipes to communicate between the three
                        processes while the second uses Semaphores and shared memory 
                        to communicate between the three processes.
                        
                        Included in this folder is a README file explaining how 
                        to compile and run the code and two .txt files explaining
                        conditons, if any, that lead to deadlock between the three
                        processes and a brief explanation of the execution order of 
                        these processes.
                        

Assignment 2:

              This assignment was done using peer programming techniques.
              
              Part 1 -> Answers to the concept questions in the pdf file on course website.
              
              Part 2 -> Designing and Implementating a Scheduler Simulator using
                        FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduler and a externally
                        based Priority scheduler.
                        
                        part2.c -> C source file that contains both schedulers
                        
                        Input.txt -> input file containing the "processes" that
                                     the simulation needs to schedule.
                                     
              README.txt -> General information about the assingment, including
                            list of files submitted, how to read the input file,
                            how to compile and run the simulation, and how to test
                            the simulation.
                            
              Report.docx -> This document contains the results of the 10 different
                             test cases that we tested the simulation against to ensure
                             that it worked properly.


Assignment 3:

              Part 1 -> Answers to the concept questions in the pdf file on course website.
              
              Part 2 -> Two different implementation of a simple prototype of an ATM
                        machine system that uses IPC services (message queues). The
                        first implementationuses processes while the second uses
                        posix threads.
